# 后悔无期
More recent work focuses on bridging the gap between fast heuristics and the slow2, but somewhat more principled, spectral approach. Defferrard et al. (NIPS 2016) approximate smooth filters in the spectral domain using Chebyshev polynomials with free parameters that are learned in a neural network-like model. They achieve convincing results on regular domains (like MNIST), closely approaching those of a simple 2D CNN model.
